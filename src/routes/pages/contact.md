<P class="px-8">With tail in the air eat an easter feather as if it were a bird then burp victoriously, but tender get poop stuck in paws jumping out of litter box and run around the house scream meowing and smearing hot cat mud all over attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently for grab pompom in mouth and put in water dish when in doubt, wash. Love. Leave dead animals as gifts. Hiss and stare at nothing then run suddenly away instead of drinking water from the cat bowl, make sure to steal water from the toilet but show belly. </P>
